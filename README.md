# neovim-setup
My JavaScript focused NeoVim setup.

## Installing & Running
- Create a nvim config file by running ```mkdir ~/.config/nvim```
- Go into directory by running ```cd ~/.config/nvim```
- Create new ```init.vim``` by running ```touch init.vim```
- Copy all of the content from the ```init.vim``` in the repository into the ```init.vim``` on your computer
- Save the file
- Quit NeoVim and open it again
- Once opened go into command mode and run ```:PlugInstall```
- This should install all the plugins
- Once installed restart NeoVim
- Thats it :)
